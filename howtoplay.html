        Highcarder - How to Play
      </h1>
      <p>
        Highcarder is a roguelike poker-inspired deckbuilder card game where the main goal is to earn
        as high of a score as possible through playing Poker Hands with an ever-dwindling deck of playing
        cards—earning packs, perks, and upgrades for your deck along the way—whilst trying not to run out of cards.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        The Basics
      </h2>
      <p><b>In Highcarder, your main aim is to survive as many "antes" as possible without running out of cards.</b>
      </p>

      <li>You start with a basic 52 card deck and 7 cards in your hand.</li>
      <li>There are 5 rounds in every ante.</li>
      <li>You progress each round by playing a poker hand.</li>
      <li>The score threshold will increase every ante.</li>
      <li>You cannot progress onto the next ante until you meet the score requirement.</li>
      <li>Every five antes, the difficulty will further increase and a debuff will be added.</li>
      <li>There is no win condition, only a lose condition: <b>Run out of cards to play.</b></li>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Poker Hands & Scoring
      </h2>
      <p>Scoring in Highcarder is as followed: </p>
      <p>( Base Hand Score + Total of "Add Score" Passive(s) ) * Total Ranks Played * Total of "Add Mult" Passives </p>
    </div>

      <h2>
        Upgrading your Deck
      </h2>

      <p>After every ante, you are given the chance to "upgrade" your deck either by: adding more cards via
        <b>Packs</b>; shaping your deck via <b>Refinements</b>; improving your chances of moving onto the next ante with
        <b>Perks</b>; or creating synergies to better your deck's performance with <b>Abilities</b>. However...
      </p>

      <p><i>To be able to upgrade your deck, you need to meet the score requirement.</i></p>

      <p>Exceeding the score requirement allows you choose multiple upgrades—one for each multiple of the requirement.
        For example, if your score is 3000 and the requirement is 300, you can choose 10 upgrades (3000 ÷ 300 = 10)
      </p>

      <h3>Rarities</h3>
      <p>Each upgrade has its own rarity, as common with many roguelike games. Some upgrades are more rarer than
        others, and thus are more stronger than others. The rarities within Highcarder as followed.
      </p>
      <li>Common (70%) - The basic bunch, ordinary and simple.</li>
      <li>Uncommon (15%) - More specialized, but nothing too special.</li>
      <li>Rare (6%) - Often times key to strategies, the engine to get things going.</li>
      <li>Mythical (2.5%) - "Event-tier" upgrades that can turn the tables.</li>
      <li>Legendary (0.5%) - The rarest out of them all, often setting you up for several antes.</li>
      <li>Cursed (1.5%) - High risk, high reward. They come with a heafty price, so don't be too greedy.</li>

      <h3>Skip / Store</h3>
      <p>If you don't like the current choice of upgrades, you are able to skip them and store the current upgrade
        point for the next upgrade phase. Doing this comes at a price however, as if you're unable to progress to
        the next ante within the round limit, you will lose the points you have stored.
      </p>

      <h3>Burning and Freezing Upgrades</h3>
      <p>During the upgrade phase, you are able to "burn" or "freeze" an upgrade. You will start with 3 burns and
        freezes, and are able to gain more through Perks.
        <br><br>
        Burning an upgrade means to permanently remove it from your current playthrough entirely, allowing you to filter
        through and thin the immense amount of upgrades within the pool. Once an upgrade has been burnt, you can never
        recover
        it, so choose wisely. You are unable to burn Cursed upgrades however.
        <br><br>
        Freezing an upgrade means to keep it within your choices indefinately until you select it, allowing you to hold
        onto an upgrade if you're feeling indecisive. You cannot have more than one frozen upgrade at any time. You are
        also able to unfreeze a frozen ability at any time, though this will not recover a freeze used, so choose
        wisely.
