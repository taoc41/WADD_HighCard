        Highcarder - How to Play
      </h1>
      <p>
        Highcarder is a roguelike poker-inspired deckbuilder card game where the main goal is to earn
        as high of a score as possible through playing Poker Hands with an ever-dwindling deck of playing
        cards—earning packs, perks, and upgrades for your deck along the way—whilst trying not to run out of cards.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        The Basics
      </h2>
      <p><b>In Highcarder, your main aim is to survive as many "antes" as possible without running out of cards.</b>
      </p>

      <li>You start with a basic 52 card deck and 7 cards in your hand.</li>
      <li>There are 5 rounds in every ante.</li>
      <li>You progress each round by playing a poker hand.</li>
      <li>The score threshold will increase every ante.</li>
      <li>You cannot progress onto the next ante until you meet the score requirement.</li>
      <li>Every five antes, the difficulty will further increase and a debuff will be added.</li>
      <li>There is no win condition, only a lose condition: <b>Run out of cards to play.</b></li>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Scoring
      </h2>

      <p>
        Scoring in Highcarder is done by playing poker hands. The stronger the poker hand, the higher the score.
        Each poker hand has their own base score, however, they can be increased by playing high ranking cards!
      </p>

      <p>
        A card's rank contributes to the "Multiplier", which multiplies the base score by the total sum of ranks
        played that make up the poker hand. Higher ranks, mean a higher multiplier!
      </p>

        <img src="./assets/images/abilities.png" alt="Abilities.">
      </div>
      
      <p>Abilities can also influence the score and multiplier through effects that require conditions to activate.
        Abilities are perhaps one of the most important aspects to Highcarder, as they're what keeps you alive and 
        going, either adding cards or making sure you're always reaching the upgrade requirement.

      <h2>
        Upgrading your Deck
      </h2>

      <p>After every ante, you are given the chance to "upgrade" your deck either by: adding more cards via
        <b>Packs</b>; shaping your deck via <b>Refinements</b>; improving your chances of moving onto the next ante with
        <b>Perks</b>; or creating synergies to better your deck's performance with <b>Abilities</b>. However...
      </p>

      <p><i>To be able to upgrade your deck, you need to meet the score requirement.</i></p>

      <p>Exceeding the score requirement allows you choose multiple upgrades—one for each multiple of the requirement.
        For example, if your score is 3000 and the requirement is 300, you can choose 10 upgrades (3000 ÷ 300 = 10)
      </p>

      <div id="margin"></div>
      <h3>Rarities</h3>
      <p>Each upgrade has its own rarity, as common with many roguelike games. Some upgrades are more rarer than
        others, and thus are more stronger than others. The rarities within Highcarder as followed.

      <h3>Skip / Store</h3>
      <p>If you don't like the current choice of upgrades, you are able to skip them and store the current upgrade
        point for the next upgrade phase. Doing this comes at a price however, as if you're unable to progress to
        the next ante within the round limit, you will lose the points you have stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also choose to skip the upgrade phase entirely, if you have too many upgrades. Your points will be
        stored for the next upgrade phase if you decide to end the upgrade phase entirely.
      </p>

      <h3>Burning and Freezing Upgrades</h3>
      <p>During the upgrade phase, you are able to "burn" or "freeze" an upgrade. You will start with 3 burns and
        freezes, and are able to gain more through Perks.
        <br><br>
        Burning an upgrade means to <b>permanently remove it</b> from your current playthrough entirely, allowing you to filter
        through and thin the immense amount of upgrades within the pool. Once an upgrade has been burnt, you can never
        recover
        it, so choose wisely. You are unable to burn Cursed upgrades however.
        <br><br>
        Freezing an upgrade means to keep it within your choices indefinately until you select it, allowing you to hold
        onto an upgrade if you're feeling indecisive. You are also able to unfreeze a frozen ability at any time, though 
        this will not recover a freeze used, so choose wisely.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Tips and Tricks!
      </h2>
      <p>
        You are able to drag and drop your cards to sort them! Some refinements also rely on card positions, so this will
        be useful later down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are the abilities and debuff displays getting in the way? Try clicking on them! You're able to
        collapse them and open them at any time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Try experimenting with hand types once you get more than 4 of the same card... you never know, you may
        discover something that would be considered illegal in regular poker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abilities with an "x Mult" effect will instead multiply your multiplier (including any +Mult effects 
        from other abilities)! If you come across any, make sure to take them!
      </p>
      <p>
        Frozen upgrades will persist even to the next upgrade phase! You even also freeze more than one upgrade, 
        just don't be too indecisive and waste them all at the same time.
      </p>
